This project is DEAD, kept here for posterity's sake. It is a fairly simple Java Swing application that uses brute force to find solutions to the [Puzzle Panel](http://www.mariowiki.com/Puzzle_Panel) minigame in [Super Mario 64 DS](http://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_64_DS). Written circa 2012 (based on the last modified date).
